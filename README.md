# Dagger-Hilt
This is basic Dagger Hilt Setup.
I'm just showing the basic difference if we use defendency like Dagger Hilt. 
Our code will be clean and easily testable & not include boiler plate code.
Here we also writing code in genenral way and shoing the difference how many times we need to write same code.
For better realization we need large project to setup dagger hilt & it will reduce the boiler plate code.
